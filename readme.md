# ðŸ”’ Open Safe AI

Open Safe AI is a lightweight project aiming to provide a safe and transparent local LLM server.

## ðŸš€ Overview

Many local LLM projects claim to be secure, but the reality is that their codebases are often too large and complex to verify easily.
Open Safe AI is built with a different philosophy:

 -	âœ… Minimal features
 -	âœ… Short, readable code
 -	âœ… Transparent and verifiable data flow

The goal is to make AI systems that anyone can inspect, understand, and trust.
